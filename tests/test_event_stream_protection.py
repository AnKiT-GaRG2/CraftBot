"""
Summarization must never collapse the newest event of a protected kind (e.g.
`requirements` from set_requirement, which lives only in the event stream and
defines the task's definition-of-done). Each one is a complete snapshot, so the
older ones are superseded and fold like any other event: a long-lived session
must not carry every past task's contract in every prompt (observed
2026-10-16 in lui_9a07529e: 9 pinned snapshots, ~5.3k tokens, back to the
previous day).
